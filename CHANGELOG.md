# Changelog

## 0.4.2

* Version number is always next to the project name.

## 0.4.1

* Use Google Fonts instead of self-hosting. (Will still work offline but with non-optimal fonts.)
* Add support for header hashes in project file links.
* Fix code block styling in comment area

## 0.4.0

Major update.

* Switching over to ES6 classes. (Don't worry, the old API still works.)
* Switched the template engine from `handlebars` to `hogan.js` for (supposedly) faster build times
* Rewrote file list style. More reliable and simpler.

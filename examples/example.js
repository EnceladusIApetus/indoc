/// To ignore a comment, simply remove the space at the start of the comment;
/// for example, instead of using two forwards slashes, I've used three.

/// However, this does not work for multi-line comments, because of the many
/// existing documentation generators that use `/**` as the identifier for the

// This function prints out 'Hello, World!', then prints out the
// answer to life, the universe, and everything.

// This is a very very long part of the code without spaces.
